# Frontend README.md

Welcome to the Frontend of our MERN Stack CRUD Operations Project! This section of the project focuses on explaining how CRUD operations are implemented using React and the Axios library for making HTTP requests to the backend server.

**1. Overview:**

The frontend of our project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to send HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend server.

**2. CRUD Operations with Axios:**

We implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Axios to communicate with the backend server. Here's a brief overview of how each operation is handled:

- **Create (POST):**

  - When a user submits a form to create a new resource, we use Axios to send a POST request to the corresponding endpoint on the backend server.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    axios
      .post("/api/resources", newData)
      .then((response) => {
        // Handle success
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

- **Read (GET):**

  - When the component mounts or when needed, we use Axios to send a GET request to fetch existing resources from the backend server.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    axios
      .get("/api/resources")
      .then((response) => {
        // Handle success
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

- **Update (PUT/PATCH):**

  - When a user updates an existing resource, we use Axios to send a PUT or PATCH request to the backend server.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    axios
      .put(`/api/resources/${id}`, updatedData)
      .then((response) => {
        // Handle success
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

- **Delete (DELETE):**
  - When a user deletes an existing resource, we use Axios to send a DELETE request to the backend server.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    axios
      .delete(`/api/resources/${id}`)
      .then((response) => {
        // Handle success
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

**3. Data Flow in CRUD Operations:**

- **Create**: User submits form -> Axios sends POST request to backend -> Backend creates new resource in database -> Frontend updates UI with new data.

- **Read**: Component mounts or when needed -> Axios sends GET request to backend -> Backend fetches resources from database -> Frontend updates UI with fetched data.

- **Update**: User updates data -> Axios sends PUT/PATCH request to backend -> Backend updates resource in database -> Frontend updates UI with updated data.

- **Delete**: User triggers delete action -> Axios sends DELETE request to backend -> Backend deletes resource from database -> Frontend updates UI to reflect deletion.

**4. Axios Interactions with Backend:**

- Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests and handle responses.
- We configure Axios to send requests to the appropriate endpoints on the backend server, which are defined using Express.js routes.

**5. Additional Notes:**

- Ensure that the backend server is running locally or deployed to a server accessible from the frontend.
- Handle success and error responses appropriately in Axios requests to provide a smooth user experience.

That's a brief overview of how CRUD operations are implemented in our frontend using React and the Axios library. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
